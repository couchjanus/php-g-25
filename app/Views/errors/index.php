                <p>Error pages could be boring, or they could be cool and attention-grabbing. Hey, you should keep your site visitors impressed and fascinated. Even when it comes to a 404 error page, you can have it in tune with your page style and keep the branding intact. On top of that, call-to-action button links back to your index page, and, chances are, they will take action. Regardless of what part or segment of your website it is, make sure you have it enhanced and customized to the very last detail. They will notice your seriousness and not be distracted, even if an OOPS! page appears in front of them.</p>
